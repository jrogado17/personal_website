                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>College Graduate from California State University, Long Beach with a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering and Physics. With a passion for technology and innovation, I gained valuable hands-on experience at Rivian Automotive, working on range certification for electric vehicle programs. I am now redirecting my career towards software engineering, with a focus on full-stack development. I am currently enrolled in a remote coding bootcamp, which will culminate in July and equip me with the necessary skills to pursue a successful career in the software industry. I am open and excited about the new opportunities that this change in direction will bring, and I am eager to bring my unique blend of technical knowledge and hands-on experience to a software development team. Let's connect and explore potential collaborations!</p>
